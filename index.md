### Projects 

[End-to-End Language Modeling and Text Generation using LSTM](/sample_page)

Language modeling is the core element of various Natural Language Processing tasks such as Speech-to-Text, Conversational Systems, and Text Generation.
<br>

This project develops a LSTM Network that will develop fake TV scripts for the popular 90's show Seinfeld utilizing the Kaggle Seinfeld Dataset that contains script data for 9 seasons.
<br>

The trained model is served on AWS for real-time inference utilizing a PyTorch Layer and a REST API that accepts as a POST request one of the names of the starring cast.

[Speech Tagging](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bhargavsaidasari/Speech-Tagging-Web-App/blob/master/index.html)

Speech Tagging is an important task in Natural Language Processing and finds applications in Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, and Word Sense Disambiguation. 
<br>

This project builds a Speech Tagger utilizing a bigram Hidden Markov Model for training, Viterbi decoding for inference, deployed using AWS Lambda, and configured to use real-time requests from a web-app with REST API backend.
