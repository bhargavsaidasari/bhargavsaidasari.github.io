### Projects 

[End-to-End N-Gram Language Modeling using LSTM](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bhargavsaidasari/text_generation_webapp/blob/master/index.html)

This project develops a LSTM Network that will develop fake TV scripts for the popular 90's show Seinfeld utilizing the Kaggle Seinfeld Dataset that contains script data for 9 seasons.

The trained model is served on AWS for real-time inference utilizing a PyTorch Layer and a REST API that accepts as a POST request one of the names of the starring cast.

[Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Model](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bhargavsaidasari/Speech-Tagging-Web-App/blob/master/index.html)

This project builds a Speech Tagger utilizing a Bigram Hidden Markov Model for training, Viterbi decoding for inference, deployed using AWS Lambda, and configured to use real-time requests from a web-app with REST API backend.

[English-Hindi Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/bhargavsaidasari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/English-Hindi-Translation)

This project implements a English-Hindi Machine Translation Network with Attention mechanism from scratch utilizing data from Ted Talk Scripts and News Articles.

The encoder is a multi-layered Bidirectional GRU, decoder is based on the Bahdanau Attention mechanism, and adaptive Teacher-Forcing is implemented to speeden up convergence during training while also avoiding model instability during inference.
